## Challenge Description

Deploying and Scaling a Kubernetes Application with Terraform
Task
Your company is launching a new product, and you are responsible for deploying and managing the infrastructure. You need to create a Kubernetes cluster to run the application, use Terraform to automate the creation of the necessary cloud resources, and deploy a database to store data generated by the application.

**Requirements:**

1. The application should be accessible via a publicly accessible domain.
1. The application should use a database to store data generated by the application.
1. The database should be scalable and able to handle a large number of concurrent
users.
1. The infrastructure should be secure and follow best practices.

**Instructions:**

1. Use Terraform to create the necessary cloud resources (e.g., VMs, load balancers, databases) to run the application and the database.
1. Deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster.
1. Deploy the database to the infrastructure and configure it for high availability and
scalability.
1. Ensure that the application is accessible via a publicly accessible domain.
1. Scale the application and the database to handle a large number of concurrent users.
1. Secure the infrastructure and follow best practices.


### Missing Steps
